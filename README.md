# DSA Stack Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various data structure and algorithm problems using stacks in C++.

## Overview

Stacks are a fundamental data structure that follow a last in, first out (LIFO) order. They have many applications in algorithms and problem solving.

This repo focuses on solving stack-based problems in categories like but not limited to:

- String/Array Reversal
- Balancing Symbols 
- Evaluating Expressions
- Celebrity Problem

## Solutions

Each file contains a stack-based solution to a specific problem. The problems were sourced from GeeksforGeeks [Stack Data Structure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/?ref=lbp) article and practice problems.

## Running the Solutions

The solutions are compiled and run as standalone C++ files. For example:

```
g++ solutions/reverse_string.cpp
./a.out
```

Each file contains a `main()` function to test and demonstrate the solution.
